-- Adapters
-- Oil does all of its filesystem interaction through an adapter abstraction. In practice, this means that oil can be used to view and modify files in more places than just the local filesystem, so long as the destination has an adapter implementation.
--
-- Note that file operations work across adapters. This means that you can use oil to copy files to/from a remote server using the ssh adapter just as easily as you can copy files from one directory to another on your local machine.
--
-- SSH
-- This adapter allows you to browse files over ssh, much like netrw. To use it, simply open a buffer using the following name template:
--
-- nvim oil-ssh://[username@]hostname[:port]/[path]
return {
	"stevearc/oil.nvim",
	opts = {},
	-- Optional dependencies
	dependencies = { "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons" },
	config = function()
		require("oil").setup({
			-- Keymaps in oil buffer. Can be any value that `vim.keymap.set` accepts OR a table of keymap
			-- options with a `callback` (e.g. { callback = function() ... end, desc = "", mode = "n" })
			-- Additionally, if it is a string that matches "actions.<name>",
			-- it will use the mapping at require("oil.actions").<name>
			-- Set to `false` to remove a keymap
